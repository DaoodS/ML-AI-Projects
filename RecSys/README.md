## RecSys & Reinforcement Learning

These are my projects related to various Recommendation system and Reinforcement learning concepts and implementations.

### Project 01: Sentiment Based Recommendation System

• Recommendation system based on sentiments extracted from the reviews and user based recommendations from product ratings given by the customers

### Project 02: Store Inventory Management

• Store Inventory Management solved using MDP and Vanilla Q-learning refinforcement learning algorithms
• Python implementation

### Project 03: Tic-Tac-Toe

• Rl agent that learns to play Numerical Tic-Tac-Toe with odd numbers (where the agent will always make the first move).
• Python implementation using Q-learning refinforcement learning algorithms

### Project 04: Cab Driver Retention

• RL-based algorithm which can help cab drivers maximise their profits by improving their decision-making process on the field.
• Python implementation using Vanilla DQN (Deep Q-learning) refinforcement learning algorithms
