### Project 1: Titanic Survival Exploration

• Created decision functions to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passenger’s features. • Started with a simple algorithm and increased its complexity until I was able to accurately predict the outcomes for at least 80% of the passengers in the provided data.

### Project 2: Predicting Boston Housing Prices

• Built a model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. • Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.

### Project 3: Finding Donors

• Applied different classifiers to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. • Obtained an accuracy of over 80% by improving the model and its complexity.

### Project 4: Creating Customer Segments

• Reviewed unstructured data to understand the patterns and natural categories that the data fits into. • Made predictions about the natural categories of multiple types in a dataset, then checked these predictions against the result of unsupervised analysis.
